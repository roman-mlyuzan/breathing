## Pre-Session Setup (15-30 minutes before start)

### Space Preparation

**Physical Setup:**
- [ ] Room temperature comfortable (68-72°F / 20-22°C)

- [ ] Pillows for head and knee support
- [ ] Eye masks available (optional)
- [ ] Tissues accessible (emotional releases may occur)
- [ ] Water station set up (participants should hydrate before)
- [ ] Lighting dimmable (bright for opening, dim for journey, gentle for integration)

**Safety Essentials:**
- [ ] First aid kit accessible
- [ ] Emergency contact info on hand
- [ ] Clear exit paths (in case someone needs to leave)
- [ ] Bathroom location communicated
- [ ] Buckets or bags available (nausea is rare but possible)

**Band Coordination:**
- [ ] Brief band on session structure
- [ ] Establish visual communication signals
- [ ] Test music volume (participants need to hear you, but also feel music)
- [ ] Confirm all musicians have cue sheets

### Personal Preparation

**Ground Yourself:**
- 10 minutes of your own breathing practice
- Set clear intention for the session

- Center in calm, grounded presence

**Review:**
- Participant intake forms (medical conditions, triggers, intentions)
- Contraindications list (who should not do intense breathwork)
- Emergency protocols

---

## Phase 0: Opening & Orientation (Before music starts, ~10 minutes)

### Welcome Circle (5 minutes)

**Sitting in circle format:**

"Welcome everyone. My name is [name], and I'll be guiding this 40-minute breathing journey today. Before we begin, let's go around the circle. Share your name and, if you'd like, what brought you here today or what you're hoping to experience."

**Listen attentively to each person. Note:**
- Anyone expressing anxiety (offer extra reassurance)
- Physical conditions mentioned (monitor during session)
- Intentions shared (affirm and validate)

### Safety Orientation (3 minutes)

**Essential information to convey:**

"This session will involve deep, conscious breathing synchronized with live music. Here's what you need to know:

**What to Expect:**
- We'll move through calm and energetic breathing patterns
- Physical sensations are normal: tingling in hands/feet, temperature changes, emotional waves
- You might feel energy moving through your body, or emotions surfacing - this is welcome and safe

**Your Self-Regulation Tools:**
- If it ever feels like too much, slow down your breathing
- You can always open your eyes and look around to ground yourself
- You can sit up anytime
- You can leave the room if needed (no explanation necessary)

**Safety Boundaries:**
- No forced breath holding (follow natural rhythm)
- If you experience chest pain, severe dizziness, or trouble breathing, raise your hand immediately
- I'll be in the room the whole time, watching and available

**Contraindications - Do NOT participate if you:**
- Are pregnant
- Have severe cardiovascular conditions
- Have uncontrolled high blood pressure
- Have had recent surgery
- Have active psychosis or severe mental health crisis
- Have history of seizures (consult first)

Does anyone have questions or concerns before we begin?"

**Address all questions fully. Better to take extra time than leave someone anxious.**

### Setting Intentions (2 minutes)

"Let's take a moment to set an intention. Place your hand on your heart. Silently or aloud, offer an intention for this session. What do you hope to release? What do you wish to invite in?

[Pause 30 seconds]

Thank you for showing up. Let's begin."

---

## Phase 1: Opening Calm (0:00-5:00)

### Scene: Establishing Safety & Technique

**BPM:** 48-52 BPM
**Breathing Target:** 6-8 breaths/min

### Your Approach

**Minute 0-1: Getting Comfortable**

*[Music begins softly - ambient, minimal]*

"Find a comfortable position lying down on your mat. Pillow under your head, perhaps one under your knees. Let your arms rest by your sides, palms facing up if that feels good. Close your eyes or use an eye mask if you'd like."

*[Pause 15 seconds - let them settle]*

**Minute 1-3: Establishing Breath Pattern**

"We'll begin with slow, deep breathing. Breathe in through your nose... [inhale audibly as model]... and out through your mouth with a gentle sigh... [exhale audibly: 'ahhhhh']

Breathe in through your nose... and out through your mouth.

In through your nose... out with a sigh.

Let your breath be natural and full. Belly rising on the inhale... belly falling on the exhale. Nothing forced, just conscious and full.

[Continue cueing every 2-3 breaths for 2 minutes]"

**Minute 3-5: Reducing Verbal Cues**

"Beautiful. Now I'm going to speak less and let the music guide you. Keep breathing - in through your nose, out through your mouth. Let the rhythm of the music match your breath. I'm right here with you."

*[Reduce to silence. Let music and drummer guide. Scan room visually - check everyone is breathing comfortably]*

### Key Points
- Your voice should be calm, warm, and unhurried
- Breathe audibly so they can hear and match your pattern
- Make eye contact if anyone looks anxious
- Move slowly through the room (not hovering, but present)

---

## Phase 2: First Energetic Wave (5:00-13:00)

### Scene: Building Energy, Encouraging Activation

**BPM:** 50 → 120 BPM
**Breathing Target:** 8 → 25 breaths/min

### Your Approach

**Minute 5-7: Transition to Faster Breathing**

"Now we're going to pick up the pace of our breathing. Faster breaths - in and out through your mouth. Let your breath become continuous with no pause between inhale and exhale. This is called circular breathing or connected breathing.

Breathe in... and out... in... and out... like a circle. No pause at the top or bottom. Keep it flowing.

[Breathe audibly and faster - model the pattern]

You might start to feel tingling in your hands or feet - this is completely normal and safe. Keep breathing.

[Minute 7: reduce verbal cues, let music drive]"

**Minute 7-10: Encouragement**

*[Speak less frequently now - every 2-3 minutes only]*

"Stay with it. Keep breathing. Trust the process."

[Minute 9:]
"You're doing great. Let the breath move through you."

**Minute 10-13: Peak Approach**

[Minute 11:]
"We're building to the peak now. Faster breathing, full breaths. Let yourself go. No holding back. Breathe fully and freely."

[Minute 12:]
"If emotions come up - anger, joy, sadness - let them move through you. Breathe through it. You're safe."

### Key Points
- Speak minimally - music and their own experience are the primary guides
- Voice should be encouraging but not jarring
- Watch for signs of hyperventilation (too-rapid breathing, panic)
  - If seen: approach quietly, place hand on person's belly, say softly "slow down, you're safe"
- Scan room constantly - read energy and needs

---

## Phase 3: Second Calm (13:00-21:00)

### Scene: Deep Rest & Integration

**BPM:** 120 → 48 BPM
**Breathing Target:** 25 → 6 breaths/min

### Your Approach

**Minute 13-15: Guiding the Descent**

"Now we're going to slow down. Let your breathing soften and deepen. Slow it down... returning to natural breath.

In through your nose... out through your mouth. Slower now. Letting go.

[Breathe audibly - model the slowdown]

Let your body rest. Let your mind rest. You're safe. You're held."

**Minute 15-21: Silent Space Holding**

*[Speak only once or twice in this entire 6-minute period - if at all]*

[Minute 16 - optional:]
"Just breathe naturally. Rest deeply."

[Minute 19 - optional:]
"Extend your exhale... longer and longer... releasing fully."

**[Otherwise: SILENCE]**

### Key Points
- This is the most meditative phase - honor it with minimal speaking
- Your role is to **hold space silently**
- Maintain presence through posture and calm energy
- Watch for emotional releases (crying, shaking) - normal and healthy
  - Stay present, don't intervene unless someone signals distress
  - Offer tissues quietly if tears flow
- This phase brings insights - don't interrupt with words

---

## Phase 4: Second Energetic Peak (21:00-31:00)

### Scene: Supporting Breakthrough

**BPM:** 48 → 128 BPM
**Breathing Target:** 6 → 30+ breaths/min

### Your Approach

**Minute 21-24: Re-Activation**

"Here we go again. Building back up. Faster breathing now - in and out, connected, circular.

[Breathe audibly - model the increase]

In and out... in and out... let the breath move energy through your body. No holding back. This is your time to let go.

[Minute 23:]
"Keep breathing. Stay with it. You're doing beautifully."

**Minute 24-28: Peak Support**

[Minute 25:]
"Full breaths. Fast and full. Let yourself feel everything. This is your breakthrough moment. Breathe into it."

[Minute 27:]
"Whatever is moving in you - joy, grief, rage, bliss - give it breath. Let it out. You're safe to feel it all."

**Minute 28-31: Peak Plateau**

[Minute 29:]
"This is the peak. Stay here with me. Breathe fully. Let yourself be exactly where you are."

[Minute 30 - prepare for descent:]
"Beautiful. We're going to begin slowing down soon. Stay with this energy for another moment."

### Key Points
- This is often when breakthroughs happen - emotional releases, insights, shifts
- Your words give permission and encouragement
- Watch for intense reactions:
  - **Crying/emotional release:** Normal. Hold space. Offer tissues if needed.
  - **Body shaking/tremoring:** Normal (energy release). Don't interfere unless person seems distressed.
  - **Vocal sounds (crying out, laughing):** Normal. Encourage it.
  - **Panic signs (gasping, eyes wide with fear):** Intervene gently - slow breathing cues, grounding touch (with consent)

---

## Phase 5: Final Integration (31:00-40:00)

### Scene: Landing & Silence

**BPM:** 120 → 44 BPM
**Breathing Target:** 30 → 5 breaths/min

### Your Approach

**Minute 31-34: Beginning Descent**

"We're slowing down now. Soften your breath. Let it become gentle and natural.

In through your nose... out through your mouth. Slower and slower.

[Breathe audibly - model the slowdown]

Landing softly. Coming back. You're safe."

**Minute 34-37: Grounding**

"Return to your natural breathing rhythm. No effort. Just let your body breathe you.

Feel the ground beneath you. Feel the weight of your body. You're here. You're safe. You're whole.

[Minute 36:]
"Extend your exhale... releasing everything you don't need. Let it go."

**Minute 37-40: Silence**

[Minute 38 - final cue:]
"For the next few minutes, rest in complete silence. Let everything you've experienced integrate. Just breathe naturally and be."

**[SILENCE until minute 40]**

*[Music fades to silence around minute 39-40]*

### Key Points
- Final verbal cues should be soft, almost whispered
- Your last words matter - choose them carefully
- The silence at the end is **sacred** - do not break it early
- Continue monitoring room but be still yourself
- Some people will fall asleep - this is fine

---

## Phase 6: Post-Session Integration (40:00-45:00)

### Scene: Gentle Return & Grounding

**Minute 40-42: Gentle Awakening**

*[Speak very softly - almost a whisper]*

"In your own time, when you're ready, begin to bring small movements back to your body. Wiggle your fingers and toes. Stretch if that feels good.

There's no rush. Take all the time you need.

When you're ready, roll to one side and rest there for a moment. Then slowly press yourself up to sitting.

Keep your eyes soft or closed as long as you need."

*[Allow 2-3 minutes for this process - don't rush anyone]*

**Minute 42-45: Grounding & Optional Sharing**

*[Once most people are sitting]*

"Welcome back. Take a moment to notice how you feel. Place your hand on your heart.

[Ring a bell or chime - signals transition]

If you'd like to share anything about your experience, we have space for that. Or you can keep it private. Both are perfect.

[If time allows and group is open - brief sharing circle. If not:]

Take your time getting up. Drink water. Move slowly. Give yourself at least 15-20 minutes before driving. The integration continues for hours and days after this experience."

**Closing:**

"Thank you for showing up. Thank you for breathing. Thank you for trusting the process. You did beautifully."

## Visual Communication with Band

### Hand Signals During Session

Establish these signals with band before session:

**Slow Down:**
- Both hands lowering slowly (palms down)
- Use if room energy needs calming

**Speed Up / More Energy:**
- Hand raising, palm up, lifting motion
- Use if room energy is lagging

**Continue / Hold Steady:**
- Flat hand moving horizontally
- Use to indicate "keep doing what you're doing"

**Volume Down:**
- Hand lowering, palm down
- Use if music too loud to hear distress or verbal cues

**Volume Up:**
- Hand raising, palm up
- Use if room needs more sonic support

**Emergency Stop:**
- Both hands raised in "stop" gesture
- ONLY if true emergency (someone injured, medical event)

---

## Safety Monitoring & Intervention

### What to Watch For

**Normal Responses (No Intervention Needed):**
- Tingling in hands/feet (tetany from CO2 changes)
- Temperature changes (hot or cold)
- Emotional releases (crying, laughing)
- Body tremoring or shaking
- Facial expressions of intensity
- Sounds (crying out, groaning, laughing)
- Deep sleep/stillness

**Warning Signs (Check In Required):**
- Extreme hyperventilation (gasping, panic breathing)
- Signs of panic (eyes wide, body rigid)
- Intense prolonged crying (>5 minutes without resolution)
- No visible breathing (check if asleep or distressed)
- Hand/mouth cramping (severe tetany)

**Intervention Protocol:**

1. **Approach calmly and quietly** (don't startle)
2. **Make eye contact** (if eyes open) or **gentle touch on shoulder** (with consent)
3. **Speak softly:** "I'm right here. You're safe. Can you slow your breathing down with me?"
4. **Model slow breathing audibly**
5. **Place hand on their belly** (if appropriate): "Breathe into my hand. Slow it down."
6. **Ground them:** "Open your eyes. Look around. You're here. You're safe."
7. **Sit with them** until regulated
8. **Offer option to continue or rest quietly**

**True Emergency (Rare):**
- Chest pain, difficulty breathing, seizure, loss of consciousness
- **Stop the session**, call 911, provide first aid
- This is extremely rare in properly screened groups

## Facilitator Presence & Mindset

### Qualities to Embody

**Grounded:**
- You are the anchor. If you're anxious, participants feel it.
- Breathe consciously throughout. Model calm.

**Non-Attached:**
- Everyone's experience is their own. Don't try to "fix" or "create" experiences.
- Your job is to hold space, not control outcomes.

**Attentive:**
- Watch without hovering
- Notice without judging
- Respond without overreacting

**Compassionate:**
- Whatever arises is welcome
- Tears are healing, not problems
- Everyone's pace is perfect

### Common Facilitator Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Talking too much** (especially during calm/integration phases)
❌ **Projecting your own experience** onto participants
❌ **Hovering anxiously** (creates anxiety in room)
❌ **Breaking silence early** (integration needs time)
❌ **Trying to "make something happen"** (trust the process)
❌ **Ignoring warning signs** (safety first always)

## Post-Session Facilitator Care

### Debriefing

**With Band:**
- Discuss how session felt
- Note any adjustments needed for next time
- Acknowledge what worked well

**With Yourself:**
- Take 15-30 minutes alone to decompress
- Journal about the session if helpful
- Release any energy you absorbed from holding space
- Hydrate and ground

### Integration Notes

Document (privately):
- General room energy and flow
- Any notable events or interventions
- Adjustments to make for future sessions
- Personal insights or learning

## Remember

You are the **space holder**. Your calm creates their safety. Your presence allows their experience. Your trust in the process gives them permission to trust theirs.

Less is more. Silence is powerful. Your grounded presence is the greatest gift.

Hold space. Trust the breath. Trust the music. Trust the process.

You are the container. Hold it with love.
