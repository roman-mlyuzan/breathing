## Phase 1: Opening Calm (0:00-5:00)

### Scene: Creating Atmosphere

**BPM:** 48-52 BPM
**Breathing Target:** 6-8 breaths/min

### Your Approach

**Minute 0-2:**
- Pure ambient texture (no rhythm, no melody)
- Sustained drones using volume pedal or ebow
- Very high register (12th fret and above) - ethereal, floating
- Let notes sustain infinitely (shimmer reverb, long delays)
- Think: clouds, mist, breath itself

**Minute 2-5:**
- Continue atmospheric approach
- Add gentle harmonic overtones (natural harmonics at 12th, 7th, 5th frets)
- Slow volume swells (bloom in, fade out)
- No chords - single notes and textures only
- Dynamics: pp

### Technique
- Volume pedal for swells (or use guitar volume knob)
- Ebow for infinite sustain (optional)
- Slide for glassy, vocal-like textures
- Tremolo picking for shimmer effect

### Gear Settings
- **Amp:** Clean, warm
- **Effects:**
  - Shimmer reverb or long hall reverb (5+ sec)
  - Long delay (1-2 sec, low mix)
  - Chorus or tremolo for movement
  - Optional: Reverse delay for otherworldly quality
- **Guitar:** Neck pickup for warmth, or bridge pickup for brightness

### Musical Notes
- **Don't play chords** - leave that space for Guitar 1
- Focus on single notes in very high or very low register
- Create layers that Guitar 1 can float above
- If Guitar 1 plays high, you play low textures (and vice versa)

---

## Phase 2: First Energetic Wave (5:00-13:00)

### Scene: Building Energy Through Texture

**BPM:** 50 → 120 BPM
**Breathing Target:** 8 → 25 breaths/min

### Your Approach

**Minute 5-7 (Transition):**
- Begin introducing subtle rhythmic pulses
- Tremolo-picked notes (creates buzzing, active texture)
- Support Guitar 1's chord changes with high register arpeggios
- Stay in background - you're adding shimmer, not leading
- Dynamics: pp → mp

**Minute 7-10 (Building):**
- Add rhythmic texture (palm-muted sixteenth notes on single strings)
- Create "motor" underneath Guitar 1's chords
- Arpeggiated picking patterns (flowing, water-like)
- Follow tempo acceleration
- Dynamics: mp → mf

**Minute 10-13 (Peak Approach):**
- **Lock into 120 BPM**
- Full rhythmic texture support
- Options:
  - Palm-muted sixteenth note "machine gun" on low E string
  - Arpeggiated chord patterns (complement Guitar 1)
  - Rhythmic scratching/percussive effects
- Add swells and ambient layers between Guitar 1's phrases
- Dynamics: mf → f

### Technique
- Palm muting for percussive texture
- Pick attack for rhythmic drive
- Rapid alternate picking for intensity
- Compression to sit in the mix

### Gear Settings
- **Amp:** Clean to slight breakup
- **Effects:**
  - Reduce reverb (1-2 sec)
  - Moderate delay (8th note or dotted 8th)
  - Possible light overdrive
- **Guitar:** Bridge pickup for brightness and cut

### Musical Notes
- **Your job:** Create the bed that Guitar 1 lies on
- If Guitar 1 plays chords, you play arpeggios or single-note textures
- If Guitar 1 plays melody, you play rhythmic/harmonic support
- Listen and respond - don't compete for space

**Example Pattern (Building):**
```
While Guitar 1 plays: | C | Am | F | G |
You play: Arpeggiated patterns or high register embellishments
```

### Key Moments
- **Minute 11:** Lock into repetitive pattern (hypnotic, trance)
- **Minute 12:** Add texture layers (delays creating cascading effects)

---

## Phase 3: Second Calm (13:00-21:00)

### Scene: Deep Soundscapes

**BPM:** 120 → 48 BPM
**Breathing Target:** 25 → 6 breaths/min

### Your Approach

**Minute 13-15 (Descent):**
- Immediately stop rhythmic playing
- Return to pure ambient texture
- Volume swells and sustained notes
- Follow drummer's deceleration with slowing of your sound density
- Dynamics: f → mp

**Minute 15-18 (Deep Rest):**
- **This is your showcase phase** - create the sonic environment
- Infinite sustain notes (ebow, volume pedal, feedback)
- Experimental sounds:
  - Bowed guitar (use cello bow or ebow)
  - Reverse delay swells
  - Feedback drones
  - Harmonic overtones
- Fill the space with atmosphere while Guitar 1 stays sparse
- Dynamics: p → pp

**Minute 18-21 (Extended Calm):**
- Continue soundscape approach
- Add gentle melodic fragments (answer Guitar 1's phrases)
- Create sense of vastness and space
- Think: deep ocean, outer space, infinite sky

### Technique
- Ebow for sustained, vocal-like tones
- Slide guitar for smooth, flowing textures
- Volume swells (no pick attack)
- Natural harmonics for bell-like clarity

### Gear Settings
- **Amp:** Clean
- **Effects:**
  - Maximum reverb (shimmer or hall, 5+ sec)
  - Long delay with high feedback (creates layers)
  - Reverse delay for bloom effect
  - Optional: Looper to create layered drones
- **Guitar:** Experiment with pickup positions for different textures

### Musical Notes
- This phase is where you shine as the texture master
- Create evolving soundscapes that breathe and shift
- No rhythm, no traditional melody - pure sonic exploration
- Support the meditative state with your textures

## Phase 4: Second Energetic Peak (21:00-31:00)

### Scene: Supporting the Breakthrough

**BPM:** 48 → 128 BPM
**Breathing Target:** 6 → 30+ breaths/min

### Your Approach

**Minute 21-24 (Re-Activation):**
- Rebuild textures quickly
- Add rhythmic elements immediately (tremolo, arpeggios)
- Support Guitar 1's chord progression with layers
- Build faster than first wave
- Dynamics: pp → f

**Minute 24-28 (Peak Plateau):**
- **Target 120-128 BPM**
- Full rhythmic texture layers
- While Guitar 1 leads melody, you provide:
  - Rhythmic/harmonic foundation (arpeggios, strummed patterns)
  - High register countermelody
  - Ambient swells between phrases
- Balance between rhythm and texture
- Dynamics: ff

**Minute 28-31 (Sustained Peak):**
- **Hold at 120 BPM**
- This is the climax - full intensity
- **Consider taking melodic lead** (minute 30-31) while Guitar 1 shifts to rhythm
- Call and response with Guitar 1
- Soaring, emotional playing
- Dynamics: ff (maximum)

### Technique
- Full pick attack for rhythm
- Expressive lead technique (bends, vibrato) when taking melody
- Layered textures using delay and reverb
- Drive/overdrive engaged

### Gear Settings
- **Amp:** Pushed to breakup
- **Effects:**
  - Moderate reverb (1-2 sec)
  - Delay for lead lines
  - Overdrive/distortion for intensity
  - Compression
- **Guitar:** Bridge pickup

### Musical Notes

**Division of Labor with Guitar 1:**
- **Minute 24-27:** You provide rhythmic/textural support, Guitar 1 leads
- **Minute 27-29:** Both playing full intensity (layered)
- **Minute 30-31:** Optional role swap - you take lead, Guitar 1 supports

**Texture Examples:**
- Arpeggiated patterns cascading down
- High register countermelody (answer Guitar 1's phrases)
- Rhythmic strumming in different register than Guitar 1

### Key Moments
- **Minute 25:** Establish your textural layer (find your space in the mix)
- **Minute 29:** Peak intensity - both guitars full power
- **Minute 30:** If taking lead, make it count (emotional, soaring)

## Phase 5: Final Integration (31:00-40:00)

### Scene: Dissolving Into Silence

**BPM:** 120 → 44 BPM
**Breathing Target:** 30 → 5 breaths/min

### Your Approach

**Minute 31-34 (Descent):**
- Rapid stripping of layers
- Stop lead playing, reduce to ambient texture
- Volume swells and sustained notes
- Follow deceleration with thinning of sound density
- Dynamics: ff → mf

**Minute 34-37 (Grounding):**
- Very sparse ambient textures
- Occasional single sustained notes (high harmonics or low drones)
- Support Guitar 1's sparse chords with atmospheric layers
- More silence than sound
- Dynamics: mf → p

**Minute 37-40 (Deep Rest & Silence):**
- Fade to complete silence
- Final 2 minutes: only occasional harmonic or swell
- **Last minute: silence** (honor the integration)
- If playing at all, barely audible (pppp)
- Let final sounds dissolve naturally
- Dynamics: p → pp → silence

### Technique
- Volume swells to fade in/out
- Natural harmonics (ethereal, bell-like)
- Ebow for final sustained tone (if any)
- Let reverb and delay trails fade naturally

### Gear Settings
- **Amp:** Clean
- **Effects:** Long reverb and delay trails carry you to silence
- **Guitar:** Neck pickup for warmth

### Musical Notes
- Support Guitar 1's final chord (if any) with high harmonic
- Consider ending on a barely audible harmonic at 12th fret
- Let the last sound ring for 20-30 seconds as it naturally decays

## Key Coordination Points

### With Guitar 1
- **Primary relationship:** You support, Guitar 1 leads
- Listen constantly - fill the spaces Guitar 1 leaves
- When Guitar 1 plays chords, you add texture/arpeggios
- When Guitar 1 plays melody, you provide harmonic/rhythmic foundation
- During peak, briefly trade roles (you lead minute 30-31)

### With Bass
- Stay out of bass's low register during calm phases
- During energetic phases, you can add low texture but don't conflict with bass notes
- If bass is driving, you add mid/high texture

### With Drummer
- Follow tempo changes precisely
- Watch for visual cues
- Lock rhythmic textures to the drum groove

### With Singer/Facilitator
- Drop to silence or bare minimum when facilitator speaks
- Support vocal toning with sustained harmonic drones
- Create bed for any singing with ambient texture

---

## Equipment & Sound

### Essential Gear
- Electric guitar
- Amp with good clean channel and reverb
- **Delay pedal** (essential for textures)
- **Reverb pedal** (shimmer reverb highly recommended)
- **Volume pedal** (for swells)
- Optional: Ebow, looper, reverse delay, tremolo, chorus

### Signal Chain
Guitar → Tuner → Overdrive → Chorus/Tremolo → Delay → Reverb → Volume Pedal → Amp
(Or: Guitar → Volume Pedal → Overdrive → Modulation → Delay → Reverb → Amp)

### Preset Suggestions
- **Preset 1:** Ambient (clean, shimmer reverb, long delay, low mix)
- **Preset 2:** Texture (clean, chorus, moderate reverb/delay)
- **Preset 3:** Peak (overdrive, compressed, moderate reverb)
- **Preset 4:** Soundscape (clean, reverse delay, shimmer reverb, high feedback)

## Mindset & Presence

### Your Role in the Journey
You are the **atmosphere and environment**. While Guitar 1 creates the path, you create the landscape. Your textures make participants feel held and immersed. During calm phases, you're the dominant sonic element.

### Energy Guidelines
- **Calm phases:** This is your time to create immersive soundscapes
- **Energetic phases:** Support and enhance Guitar 1's leadership
- **Transitions:** Use your textures to smooth the journey between states

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Competing with Guitar 1 for melodic space (support, don't compete)
- ❌ Playing too rhythmically during calm phases (texture, not rhythm)
- ❌ Being too loud in the mix (you're the bed, not the blanket)
- ❌ Using same register as Guitar 1 (find your space - high or low)
- ❌ Continuing to play during final silence (honor the stillness)

## Texture Library: Sound Ideas

### Calm Phases
- High harmonics (12th, 7th, 5th frets) - bell-like
- Ebow drones - infinite sustain, vocal quality
- Volume swells - no attack, pure bloom
- Reverse delay swells - otherworldly
- Low drones (open strings) - grounding rumble

### Energetic Phases
- Palm-muted sixteenths - motorik, driving texture
- Arpeggiated cascades - flowing, active
- Tremolo picking - shimmering intensity
- Rhythmic scratching - percussive texture
- Delay-layered patterns - complex, hypnotic

### Transition Moments
- Increasing/decreasing density (more/fewer notes)
- Volume swells that grow or shrink
- Filter sweeps (using tone knob or wah)
- Feedback control (building or taming)

## Remember

You are the **sonic landscape**. Your textures create the environment in which the breath journey happens. During calm, you're the most important guitar. During peaks, you're the essential support.

Be patient. Listen deeply. Fill space wisely. Honor silence.

You are the atmosphere. Play like it.
