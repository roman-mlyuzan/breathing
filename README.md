## 🎯 Quick Reference by Need

### "What BPM should I play?"
→ Any scene guide (Quick Reference Timeline at top)

### "What breathing rate are we targeting?"
→ `breathing-tempo-research.md` or any scene guide timeline

### "When do I speak/play less?"
→ All scene guides show dynamics and verbal cue frequency per phase

### "How do I set up my gear?"
→ Your instrument's scene guide (Equipment & Sound sections)

### "What if someone hyperventilates?"
→ `scene-facilitator.md` (Safety Monitoring section)
→ `scene-drummer.md` (Emergency Protocols section)

### "Why does 120 BPM matter?"
→ `sound-associations-breathing-exercises-report.md`
→ Research shows 120 BPM = 18.5% highest breath entrainment

### "How do we coordinate as a band?"
→ All scene guides have "Key Coordination Points" sections
→ `scene-drummer.md` (Band Coordination section)

### "What sounds should I use for calm vs energetic?"
→ Your scene guide (SPD-SX, Tone Settings, Gear Settings sections)

## 🕐 Session Timeline Overview

| Time | Phase | BPM | Energy | Who Leads |
|------|-------|-----|--------|-----------|
| 0:00-5:00 | Opening Calm | 48-52 | Grounding | Facilitator (verbal), Drummer (tempo) |
| 5:00-13:00 | First Wave | 50→120 | Building | Drummer (tempo), Bass (drive) |
| 13:00-21:00 | Second Calm | 120→48 | Deep Rest | Guitar 2 (texture), minimal drums |
| 21:00-31:00 | Second Peak | 48→128 | Breakthrough | Guitar 1 (melody), full band |
| 31:00-40:00 | Integration | 120→44 | Landing | All fade to silence |
| 40:00-45:00 | Post-Session | — | Rest | Facilitator (gentle awakening) |

## 🎵 Critical BPM Zones (Memorize These)

- **48 BPM** - Deep calm, grounding (6-8 breaths/min)
- **60 BPM** - Transition tempo
- **80-90 BPM** - Building energy, "double-time breathing" (20 breaths/min)
- **120 BPM** ⭐ - **Optimal entrainment** (highest effectiveness, 25-30 breaths/min)
- **128 BPM** - Peak activation, breakthrough (30+ breaths/min)
- **44 BPM** - Deepest rest before silence (4-5 breaths/min)

---

## 🎭 Role Relationships

**Rhythmic Foundation:**
- Drummer + Bass = Locked together (kick drum + root notes)

**Harmonic Structure:**
- Guitar 1 leads harmony and melody
- Guitar 2 supports with texture and fills
- Bass follows Guitar 1's chord changes (plays roots)

**Human Element:**
- Singer bridges instruments and participants (voice = breath model)
- Facilitator guides experience (verbal cues, safety, space)

**Visual Communication:**
- Facilitator → Band: Hand signals for tempo adjustments
- Drummer → Band: Visual cues for transitions
- All → Drummer: Eye contact during tempo changes

---

## 🚨 Safety Essentials

**Pre-Session Screening** (`scene-facilitator.md`)
- Contraindications checklist (pregnancy, cardiovascular issues, etc.)
- Participant intake forms

**During Session Monitoring** (`scene-facilitator.md`)
- Normal responses: tingling, emotions, shaking
- Warning signs: severe hyperventilation, panic, chest pain
- Intervention protocols

**Musical Safety Responses** (`scene-drummer.md`)
- If hyperventilation: slow tempo 10-15 BPM immediately
- Strip to minimal elements (kick/cymbal only)
- Create grounding, steady pulse

---

## 📋 Pre-Session Band Checklist

- [ ] All musicians have their scene guides
- [ ] Visual cue system established and tested
- [ ] Facilitator + Drummer aligned on safety protocols
- [ ] Tempo cue sheets visible for all (printed or tablet)
- [ ] Music volume balanced (participants must hear facilitator)
- [ ] Room setup complete (mats, lighting, ventilation)
- [ ] Emergency plan discussed (medical, hyperventilation)
- [ ] Run-through of critical transitions (minutes 5, 13, 21, 31)

## 💡 Key Principles

**For Musicians:**
- Less is more during calm phases (space = healing)
- Lock steady at 120 BPM during peaks (don't rush)
- Honor the silence at the end (2-3 minutes minimum)
- You're guiding nervous systems, not performing a concert

**For Facilitator:**
- Talk less during peaks and integration (silence is powerful)
- Hold space without trying to "fix" experiences
- Safety first, always monitor the room
- Trust the process - the breath does the work

**For Everyone:**
- This is sacred work disguised as music
- Your presence and steadiness create safety
- Trust the tempo, trust the structure, trust the silence

## 📖 How to Use This Project

1. **First Read:** Your role's scene guide (understand your part)
2. **Deep Study:** Research files (understand the why)
3. **Band Rehearsal:** Run through with full band at least once
4. **Pre-Session:** Review your scene guide's pre-checklist
5. **During Session:** Use Quick Reference Timeline at top of scene guide
6. **Post-Session:** Debrief with band, note adjustments

## 🙏 Final Note

This breathing session is designed to guide participants through a complete nervous system journey:

**Opening (0-5):** Safety and grounding
**Wave 1 (5-13):** Activation and energy
**Rest 1 (13-21):** Deep integration
**Wave 2 (21-31):** Breakthrough and release
**Integration (31-40):** Complete landing
**Silence (40-43):** Sacred completion

Your role—whatever it is—serves this journey. Play with presence, hold with care, and trust the breath.

**Breathe. Play. Serve.**
