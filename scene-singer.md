## Phase 1: Opening Calm (0:00-5:00)

### Scene: Vocal Grounding

**BPM:** 48-52 BPM
**Breathing Target:** 6-8 breaths/min

### Your Approach

**Minute 0-2:**
- Very soft vocal tones (no words, just vowel sounds)
- Long, sustained "Ahhhh" or "Oooo" sounds
- Match breath rate: tone for 6-8 seconds, silence for 6-8 seconds
- Dynamics: pp (barely audible)
- Think: breath made audible, not singing

**Minute 2-5:**
- Continue soft toning
- Add gentle humming (lips closed, "Mmmmm")
- Occasional breath sounds (soft inhale/exhale vocalized)
- Create sonic model of calm breathing
- Dynamics: pp to p

### Technique
- Diaphragmatic breathing (model the technique)
- Soft palate relaxed
- No vibrato (straight tone, pure)
- Nose breathing between tones
- Support from core, not throat

### Vocal Range & Quality
- **Range:** Low to middle register (grounding, not soaring)
- **Quality:** Breathy, soft, intimate (like whispering but sustained)
- **Resonance:** Chest voice (avoid head voice - too ethereal for grounding)

### Sounds to Use
- **"Ahhhh"** - open, releasing (on exhale)
- **"Oooo"** - round, containing (calming)
- **"Mmmmm"** - humming, vibrating (somatic awareness)
- Soft inhale sounds (audible but gentle)

- Vocal patterns as rhythmic element (like percussion)
- Options:
  - "Hey!" on beats 1 and 3
  - Rapid "Hah-Hah-Hah-Hah" (quarter notes or eighth notes)
  - Vocal percussion sounds (beatbox-like)
- Add melodic toning between rhythmic cues
- Dynamics: mf → f

### Technique

## Key Coordination Points

### With Facilitator
- **You may be the same person** - singer doubles as facilitator
- If separate: coordinate verbal cues vs. vocal tones
- Drop to silence when facilitator needs to speak instructions
- Support facilitator's guidance with vocal anchoring

### With Instruments
- Listen to Guitar 1 for harmonic cues (match chord tones)
- Lock rhythmic patterns with drummer
- Give space to Guitar 2's textures (don't compete)
- Support bass's grounding with low vocal tones during calm

### With Participants
- Your voice is their model and anchor
- What you do, they'll unconsciously follow
- Your breath pattern becomes their breath pattern
- Your emotional expression gives permission for theirs

## Vocal Health & Safety

### Warm-Up (Before Session)
- Lip trills (5 min)
- Humming scales (5 min)
- Gentle sirens (high to low, low to high)
- Jaw and neck stretches
- Hydrate well (room temperature water)

### During Session
- Stay hydrated (water accessible but off-mic)
- Don't strain - power comes from breath support, not throat tension
- If voice feels tired, reduce volume and increase breathiness
- Alternate between vocal engagement and silence (built into structure)

### After Session
- Cool down with gentle humming
- Avoid speaking loudly immediately after
- Continue hydrating
- Rest voice for 30-60 minutes if possible

### Warning Signs
- Throat pain or scratchiness → reduce volume, increase breath support
- Voice cracking → hydrate, ease off intensity
- Feeling lightheaded → slow your breath rate, match participants' pattern

---

## Microphone Technique

### Mic Setup
- **Distance:** 6-8 inches for sustained tones, 3-4 inches for soft tones
- **Angle:** Slightly off-axis (reduces plosives from "H" and "P" sounds)
- **Type:** Condenser mic preferred (captures breathy tones), dynamic mic works too

### Volume Levels by Phase
- **Calm phases:** Voice should blend with instruments (not lead)
- **Energetic phases:** Voice can be prominent (cutting through)
- **Transitions:** Moderate level
- **Integration:** Barely audible (may need to get very close to mic)

### Breath Noise Management
- Inhale sounds intentional during calm phases (model breath)
- Turn slightly away from mic for quick breaths during energetic phases
- Use breath sounds musically, not as accidental noise

---

## Mindset & Presence

### Your Role in the Journey
You are the **human voice in the sonic landscape** - the most relatable sound in the session. Your voice gives participants permission to make sound, to breathe, to release. During peaks, your vocal freedom models their emotional release.

### Energy Guidelines
- **Calm phases:** Your voice is a lullaby, a safe container
- **Energetic phases:** Your voice is liberation, encouragement, activation
- **Transitions:** Your voice guides the journey from state to state

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Singing "performance" instead of therapeutic toning (this isn't a concert)
- ❌ Too much voice during calm phases (less is more, silence is golden)
- ❌ Holding back during peaks (model emotional release fully)
- ❌ Ignoring own breath (you must breathe well to guide others)
- ❌ Continuing past silence point (honor the final integration)

## Remember

Breathe first. Tone from breath. Serve the journey.

You are the voice. Sing like breath itself.
