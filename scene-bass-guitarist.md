## Phase 1: Opening Calm (0:00-5:00)

### Scene: Grounding & Safety

**BPM:** 48-52 BPM
**Breathing Target:** 6-8 breaths/min

### Your Approach

**Minute 0-2:**
- Play very sparse root notes
- Whole notes or half notes only (one note per 4-8 beats)
- Focus on low register (E, A, D strings - avoid high notes)
- Let notes ring out, sustain fully
- Match kick drum hits (support, don't double)

**Minute 2-5:**
- Continue sparse approach
- Add very subtle movement (root to fifth occasionally)
- Keep dynamics soft (pp to p)
- Think: "earth, gravity, foundation"

### Technique
- Fingerstyle preferred (warmer tone)
- Light touch, let the note bloom
- Full sustain - no muting
- Consider playing with neck pickup only (darker, warmer)

### Musical Notes
- **Key:** Follow facilitator's guidance or use grounding keys (C, D, E, A)
- **Pattern:** Whole notes on root
- **Effect:** Deep, meditative, anchoring
- **Think:** Ocean floor, deep earth, slow heartbeat

---

## Phase 2: First Energetic Wave (5:00-13:00)

### Scene: Awakening & Building Energy

**BPM:** 50 → 120 BPM
**Breathing Target:** 8 → 25 breaths/min

### Your Approach

**Minute 5-7 (Transition):**
- Begin adding quarter notes (one per beat)
- Stay on root note but increase rhythmic presence
- Lock tightly with kick drum
- Gradual tempo increase with drummer
- Dynamics: mp to mf

**Minute 7-10 (Building):**
- Introduce walking bass pattern (root, third, fifth, octave)
- Syncopation with kick drum (anticipate beats)
- Support tempo acceleration
- Add slight rhythmic drive (push the beat forward gently)
- Dynamics: mf to f

**Minute 10-13 (Peak Approach):**
- **Lock into 120 BPM with drummer**
- Full walking bass line or driving eighth notes
- Consider octave jumps for energy
- Strong root note emphasis on beat 1
- Pattern can repeat (hypnotic, trance-inducing)
- Dynamics: f

### Technique
- Pick or fingerstyle (pick for more attack/clarity)
- Compress your dynamics (consistent level)
- Play on or slightly ahead of the beat (driving feel)
- Bridge pickup or both pickups (brighter, more present)

### Musical Notes
- **Pattern Example at 90 BPM:**
  ```
  Beat: 1    2    3    4
  Note: Root 5th  Root 8ve
  ```

- **Pattern Example at 120 BPM:**
  ```
  Beat: 1    2    3    4
  Note: Root 3rd  5th  6th
        Root 3rd  5th  8ve (repeat)
  ```

### Key Moments
- **Minute 11:** Lock with drummer at 120 BPM - this is your entrainment zone
- **Minute 12:** Hold steady - don't rush as energy builds

---

## Phase 3: Second Calm (13:00-21:00)

### Scene: Deep Rest & Integration

**BPM:** 120 → 48 BPM
**Breathing Target:** 25 → 6 breaths/min

### Your Approach

**Minute 13-15 (Descent):**
- Immediately simplify pattern
- Move from walking bass to whole/half notes
- Follow drummer's deceleration closely
- Strip away movement, return to root notes
- Dynamics: f → mp

**Minute 15-18 (Deep Rest):**
- Very sparse root notes (one note per 4-8 beats)
- **Add sustained drones:** Use long, held notes (let ring 8+ beats)
- Consider using low open strings (E, A) for maximum resonance
- Embrace silence between notes
- Dynamics: p to pp

**Minute 18-21 (Extended Calm):**
- Continue drone approach
- Occasional fifth or octave for subtle movement
- Support extended exhale pattern (long sustained notes)
- Play less than you think you should
- Consider harmonics or very soft plucking

### Technique
- Return to fingerstyle
- Extremely light touch
- Full sustain, no muting
- Neck pickup only (warm, dark)
- Optional: palm muting for very soft, percussive notes

### Musical Notes
- **Effect:** Deep, grounding, supportive silence
- **Think:** Deep meditation, stillness, ocean depths
- This phase is about space and rest - your absence is as important as your presence

---

## Phase 4: Second Energetic Peak (21:00-31:00)

### Scene: Breakthrough & Transformation

**BPM:** 48 → 128 BPM
**Breathing Target:** 6 → 30+ breaths/min

### Your Approach

**Minute 21-24 (Re-Activation):**
- Rebuild from sparse notes to quarter notes
- Faster acceleration than first wave
- Participants are warmed up now - you can build faster
- Lock with kick drum immediately
- Dynamics: pp → f

**Minute 24-28 (Peak Plateau):**
- **Target 120-128 BPM range**
- Full driving bass line - this is your strongest playing
- Options:
  - Walking bass (root, 3rd, 5th, octave pattern)
  - Driving eighth notes (root-fifth alternation)
  - Syncopated funk pattern (anticipate beat 1 and 3)
- Octave jumps for energy
- Strong rhythmic pulse
- Dynamics: ff

**Minute 28-31 (Sustained Peak):**
- **Hold steady at 120 BPM**
- This is the breakthrough zone - maintain consistent groove
- Play with intensity variations while keeping tempo locked
- Strong root emphasis on beat 1 (anchor point)
- Hypnotic repetition is good here

### Technique
- Pick playing for attack and clarity
- Aggressive but controlled
- Play on top of or slightly ahead of beat (drive the energy)
- Bridge pickup or both pickups
- Optional: slight overdrive/distortion for grit

### Musical Notes
- **Pattern at 120 BPM (driving):**
  ```
  Beat: 1  &  2  &  3  &  4  &
  Note: R  R  5  5  R  R  5  5
  (R=root, 5=fifth, eighth notes)
  ```

- **Pattern at 128 BPM (walking):**
  ```
  Beat: 1    2    3    4
  Note: Root 3rd  5th  b7
        Root 3rd  5th  8ve (alternate)
  ```

### Key Moments
- **Minute 25:** Lock into groove with drummer - DO NOT RUSH
- **Minute 29:** Peak intensity while maintaining steady tempo
- **Minute 30:** Subtle shift - prepare for descent (slight dynamic pullback)

---

## Phase 5: Final Integration (31:00-40:00)

### Scene: Landing & Silence

**BPM:** 120 → 44 BPM
**Breathing Target:** 30 → 5 breaths/min

### Your Approach

**Minute 31-34 (Descent):**
- Rapid simplification (reverse the build)
- Move from driving lines to quarter notes to half notes
- Follow drummer's deceleration precisely
- Strip away octave jumps, return to low register
- Dynamics: ff → mf

**Minute 34-37 (Grounding):**
- Very sparse root notes
- Deep, low register (E and A strings primarily)
- Whole notes with full sustain
- Support grounding energy (heavy, earthy)
- Dynamics: mf → p

**Minute 37-40 (Deep Rest & Silence):**
- Fade to silence gradually
- Final 2 minutes: only occasional deep root notes
- Last minute: one sustained drone or complete silence
- Let your last note ring into silence
- Dynamics: p → pp → silence

### Technique
- Fingerstyle, lightest touch
- Full sustain, no muting
- Neck pickup only
- Consider natural harmonics (12th fret) for final ethereal notes

### Musical Notes
- **Pattern (minute 34-37):**
  ```
  Beat: 1    2    3    4    1    2    3    4
  Note: Root --------------- (hold 8 beats)
  ```

- **Final approach (minute 38-40):**
  - Single whole notes every 8-16 beats
  - Eventually fade to silence
  - Optional: end with 12th fret harmonic (E or A string)

## Key Coordination Points

### With Drummer
- **Always listen to the kick drum** - you are married to it
- When drummer accelerates/decelerates, move together
- Eye contact during transitions
- If drummer gives visual cue (hand up/down), respond immediately

### With Guitars
- During calm phases: stay in low register, give guitars space above you
- During energetic phases: drive the rhythm, let guitars add texture/melody
- If guitars play chords, you play roots/arpeggios
- Listen for harmonic movement from Guitar 1, follow chord changes

### With Singer/Facilitator
- When facilitator speaks (verbal cues), drop to minimal playing
- Support singer during any toning or vocal elements
- Provide foundation for melodic elements

---

## Equipment & Sound

### Tone Settings

**Calm Phases (1, 3, 5):**
- Neck pickup only
- Tone rolled off (darker, warmer)
- No effects or subtle reverb only
- Compression minimal

**Energetic Phases (2, 4):**
- Bridge pickup or both pickups
- Tone open (brighter)
- Optional: light overdrive, compression
- Tight, punchy sound

### Signal Chain Suggestions
- Bass → Tuner → Compressor (optional) → DI → Amp
- Keep effects minimal (this isn't a guitar showcase)
- Focus on tone and rhythm, not effects

---

## Mindset & Presence

### Your Role in the Journey
You are the **anchor and foundation**. While drums provide the timing, you provide the harmonic and sonic foundation. Your deep tones help participants feel grounded and safe.

### Energy Guidelines
- **Calm phases:** Be the earth, the gravity. Participants root into your sound.
- **Energetic phases:** Be the engine, the drive. Participants ride your momentum.
- **Transitions:** Be the guide. Your movement tells participants where they're going.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Playing too busy during calm phases (less is more)
- ❌ Rushing during energetic phases (stay locked with drums)
- ❌ Continuing to play during final silence (honor the integration time)
- ❌ Playing too high in register (stay low and grounding)
- ❌ Overusing effects (clarity and simplicity serve the breath)

## Pre-Session Checklist

- [ ] Bass in tune (consider drop D for deeper root if needed)
- [ ] Fresh strings or cleaned strings (clear tone)

- [ ] Pickup selector accessible (switch between neck/bridge)
- [ ] Tone knob accessible for quick adjustments
- [ ] Tempo cue sheet visible (printed or on stand)
- [ ] Water nearby
- [ ] Extra cable, batteries, picks/fingers ready

## Quick Reference: Essential Patterns

### Calm (48-52 BPM)
```
Whole notes on root, let ring
```

### Building (80-90 BPM)
```
Beat: 1    2    3    4
Note: Root 5th  Root 8ve
```

### Peak (120 BPM)
```
Walking: Root 3rd 5th 6th → Root 3rd 5th 8ve
OR
Driving: Root-Root-5th-5th (eighth notes)
```

### Descent/Integration
```
Gradually return to whole notes on root
Fade to silence
```

## Remember

Your job is simple but essential:
- **Lock with the drums**
- **Stay low and grounding during calm**
- **Drive the rhythm during energetic peaks**
- **Fade to silence at the end**

Trust the tempo. Trust the drummer. Trust the silence.

You are the foundation. Play like it.
