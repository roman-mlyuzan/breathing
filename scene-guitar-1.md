## Phase 1: Opening Calm (0:00-5:00)

### Scene: Creating the Container

**BPM:** 48-52 BPM
**Breathing Target:** 6-8 breaths/min

### Your Approach

**Minute 0-2:**
- Very sparse chord voicings (whole notes)
- Open, ambient chords (add9, sus2, maj7 voicings)
- Let each chord ring for 8+ beats
- High register (above 7th fret) - give space to bass
- No rhythm - pure texture and harmony

**Minute 2-5:**
- Continue ambient approach
- Add very gentle arpeggios (slow, flowing)
- Single note melodies occasionally (pentatonic, whole tone scales)
- Dynamics: pp to p
- Think: sky, air, breath, space

### Technique
- Clean tone with long reverb and delay
- Fingerpicking or soft pick attack
- Volume swells (volume knob manipulation)
- Avoid sharp attacks - everything is soft and blooming

### Gear Settings
- **Amp:** Clean channel, warm setting
- **Effects:** Long reverb (3-5 sec), subtle delay (dotted eighth), optional chorus
- **Guitar:** Neck pickup or middle position (warm, round)

### Musical Notes
- **Key:** Establish tonal center (C, D, E, or A work well for grounding)
- **Chords:** Cmaj9, Dsus2, Am7add11, Emadd9
- **Feel:** Floating, spacious, infinite
- Avoid minor keys (too heavy for opening) - keep hopeful and open

## Phase 2: First Energetic Wave (5:00-13:00)

### Scene: The Awakening

**BPM:** 50 → 120 BPM
**Breathing Target:** 8 → 25 breaths/min

### Your Approach

**Minute 5-7 (Transition):**
- Begin introducing rhythm (still spacious)
- Strummed chords on beat 1 (whole notes)
- Gradual increase in rhythmic presence
- Stay ambient but add subtle pulse
- Dynamics: mp

**Minute 7-10 (Building):**
- Move to half note or quarter note chord rhythms
- Follow tempo acceleration
- Introduce simple melodic phrases between chords
- Build intensity through rhythm, not volume
- Dynamics: mf

**Minute 10-13 (Peak Approach):**
- **Lock into 120 BPM**
- Rhythmic strumming pattern (eighth notes or palm-muted sixteenths)
- Simple 2-4 chord progression (repetitive, hypnotic)
- Add melodic embellishments on top of rhythm
- This is driving, trance-inducing music
- Dynamics: f

### Technique
- Pick attack increases with energy
- Palm muting during rhythmic sections for percussive effect
- Add drive/overdrive gradually as tempo increases
- Compression to maintain consistent level

### Gear Settings
- **Amp:** Clean to slight breakup by minute 13
- **Effects:** Reduce reverb time (1-2 sec), moderate delay, possible light overdrive
- **Guitar:** Bridge pickup or middle position (brighter, more presence)

### Musical Notes

**Chord Progression Example (Building):**
```
| C | Am | F | G | (repeat)
or
| Em | C | G | D | (more energetic)
```

**Rhythmic Pattern at 120 BPM:**
```
Beat:    1  &  2  &  3  &  4  &
Strum:   ↓     ↓  ↑  ↓  ↑  ↓  ↑
         (emphasis on 1 and 3)
```

### Key Moments
- **Minute 11:** Lock the groove - establish repeating chord pattern
- **Minute 12:** Add melodic hook (simple, memorable phrase that repeats)

---

## Phase 3: Second Calm (13:00-21:00)

### Scene: The Deep Rest

**BPM:** 120 → 48 BPM
**Breathing Target:** 25 → 6 breaths/min

### Your Approach

**Minute 13-15 (Descent):**
- Immediately stop rhythmic strumming
- Return to whole note chords
- Strip away melodic activity
- Follow drummer's deceleration
- Create sense of "falling" or "landing softly"
- Dynamics: f → mp

**Minute 15-18 (Deep Rest):**
- Pure ambient texture (no rhythm)
- Sustained drones and pads
- Volume swells (attack-less chords)
- Single sustained notes with lots of reverb
- Consider using ebow or volume pedal for infinite sustain
- Dynamics: p to pp

**Minute 18-21 (Extended Calm):**
- Continue ambient soundscape
- Occasional gentle melodic fragment (pentatonic, major scale)
- High register preferred (ethereal, floating)
- Support extended exhale pattern with long sustained notes
- Embrace silence between sounds

### Technique
- Volume swells (no pick attack heard)
- Fingerpicking for gentle arpeggios
- Use reverb and delay as instruments themselves
- Optional: slide, ebow, or tremolo picking for texture

### Gear Settings
- **Amp:** Clean
- **Effects:** Maximum reverb (5+ sec decay), long delay, possible shimmer reverb
- **Guitar:** Neck pickup (warm, dark)
- Optional: Reverse delay for dreamlike quality

### Musical Notes
- **Avoid:** Rhythmic playing, sharp attacks, busy melodic lines
- **Embrace:** Space, silence, sustained tones, floating harmonies

## Phase 4: Second Energetic Peak (21:00-31:00)

### Scene: The Breakthrough

**BPM:** 48 → 128 BPM
**Breathing Target:** 6 → 30+ breaths/min

### Your Approach

**Minute 21-24 (Re-Activation):**
- Rebuild faster than first wave
- Move quickly from ambient to rhythmic
- Introduce chord progression immediately
- Quarter note strumming by minute 22
- Dynamics: pp → f

**Minute 24-28 (Peak Plateau):**
- **Target 120-128 BPM**
- Full rhythmic strumming (driving eighth notes)
- **Add melodic journey:** This is your peak moment
- Play emotional, soaring melodies over chord changes
- Use full range of guitar (low and high notes)
- Bends, vibrato, expressive playing
- Dynamics: ff

**Minute 28-31 (Sustained Peak):**
- **Hold at 120 BPM**
- This is breakthrough territory - play with emotion and presence
- Melodic peak: your most expressive playing of the session
- Create call-and-response with Guitar 2
- Build to final climax at minute 30
- Dynamics: ff (maximum intensity)

### Technique
- Full pick attack
- Aggressive strumming with dynamics
- Expressive lead playing (bends, vibrato, slides)

- Drive/overdrive engaged

### Gear Settings
- **Amp:** Pushed to edge of breakup or mild overdrive
- **Effects:** Moderate reverb (1-2 sec), delay for lead lines, compression
- **Guitar:** Bridge pickup (bright, cutting)
- Optional: Boost pedal for lead sections

### Musical Notes

**Chord Progression Example (Peak):**
```
| Em | C | G | D | (powerful, ascending)
or
| Am | F | C | G | (emotional, moving)
```

**Lead Melody Approach:**
- Use pentatonic and major scales
- Soar above the chord changes
- Simple, memorable phrases that repeat with variation
- Think: journey music, emotional release, breakthrough

### Key Moments
- **Minute 25:** Establish peak chord progression (lock it in)
- **Minute 27:** Begin melodic journey (lead guitar emerges)
- **Minute 29-30:** Peak intensity - this is the climax of the entire session
- **Minute 30-31:** Subtle shift - prepare for descent (dynamic pullback)

## Phase 5: Final Integration (31:00-40:00)

### Scene: The Return & Silence

**BPM:** 120 → 44 BPM
**Breathing Target:** 30 → 5 breaths/min

### Your Approach

**Minute 31-34 (Descent):**
- Rapid simplification
- Stop lead playing, return to chords
- Move from eighth notes → quarter notes → half notes → whole notes
- Follow drummer's deceleration closely
- Dynamics: ff → mf

**Minute 34-37 (Grounding):**
- Very sparse chord voicings
- Whole notes with lots of space
- Return to low/mid register (grounding energy)
- Simple, open chords
- Dynamics: mf → p

**Minute 37-40 (Deep Rest & Silence):**
- Fade to silence gradually
- Final 2 minutes: occasional single notes or very sparse chords
- **Last minute: complete silence** (honor the integration)
- If playing at all, use high harmonics or volume swells (barely audible)
- Dynamics: p → pp → silence

### Technique
- Return to fingerpicking or very soft pick
- Volume swells for final notes
- Natural harmonics (12th, 7th fret) for ethereal final sounds
- Let final notes ring into infinite decay

### Gear Settings
- **Amp:** Clean
- **Effects:** Long reverb returns, delay fades out
- **Guitar:** Neck pickup

### Musical Notes
- Return to opening key/chords (create circular journey)
- Final chord (if any): Open, consonant voicing (maj7, add9)
- Consider ending on a high harmonic (E or B at 12th fret) that fades to silence

## Key Coordination Points

### With Drummer
- Watch for visual cues during transitions
- Lock your rhythm to the drums during energetic phases
- Follow tempo changes precisely

### With Bass
- Stay harmonically aligned (you establish chords, bass plays roots)
- Give bass space in low register - you stay mid/high
- During peaks, you drive melody while bass drives rhythm

### With Guitar 2
- **Division of labor:**
  - You: Harmonic foundation and primary melody
  - Guitar 2: Texture, ambient fills, supportive melody
- Trade lead roles during peak (you lead minutes 27-29, Guitar 2 can lead minute 30-31)
- Communicate chord changes visually or pre-arrange progression

### With Singer/Facilitator
- Drop volume when facilitator speaks (verbal cues)
- Support any vocal toning or singing with harmonic foundation
- Listen for melodic cues from singer

## Mindset & Presence

### Your Role in the Journey
You are the **harmonic guide and emotional storyteller**. Your chords create the landscape, and your melodies lead the journey. During peaks, your playing helps participants access emotion and breakthrough.

### Energy Guidelines
- **Calm phases:** Create space and atmosphere. You're painting sky and air.
- **Energetic phases:** Drive emotion through melody. You're the voice of the journey.
- **Transitions:** Guide with your harmonic choices. You show where we're going.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Playing too many notes during calm phases (space is golden)
- ❌ Not committing to intensity during peaks (this isn't background music)
- ❌ Continuing to play during final silence (honor the stillness)
- ❌ Noodling without purpose (every note serves the breath)
- ❌ Ignoring the harmonic structure (stay organized, don't wander)

## Musical Journey Arc

Think of your 40 minutes as a story:

**Opening (0-5):** "Once upon a time... stillness"
**First Rise (5-13):** "Something begins to stir... awakening"
**Deep Rest (13-21):** "Diving deep into the ocean... finding peace"
**Second Rise (21-31):** "Rising to the surface... breakthrough into light"
**Integration (31-40):** "Returning home... complete"

Play the story. Feel the journey. Serve the breath.

## Remember

You are the **emotional heart** of this experience. Your melodies during peaks will be what participants remember. Your space during calm will be what they feel.

Trust your harmonic choices. Trust your melodies. Trust the silence.

You are the journey. Play like it.
