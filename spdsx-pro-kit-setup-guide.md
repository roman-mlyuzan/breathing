# SPD-SX Pro: 8-Kit Tempo Setup Guide
## Breathing Session Optimized Configuration

**Strategy:** 8 kits covering critical BPMs from breathing session
**Advantage:** Instant tempo changes via kit switching (no tempo knob adjustments)

## SPD-SX Pro Pad Layout

Standard 9-pad configuration (3x3 grid):

```
┌─────────┬─────────┬─────────┐
│  PAD 7  │  PAD 8  │  PAD 9  │
│ Texture │ Effect/ │ Accent  │
│ /Perc   │ Riser   │ /Cymbal │
├─────────┼─────────┼─────────┤
│  PAD 4  │  PAD 5  │  PAD 6  │
│Hi-Hat/  │ Snare/  │  Tom/   │
│ Shaker  │  Clap   │  Conga  │
├─────────┼─────────┼─────────┤
│  PAD 1  │  PAD 2  │  PAD 3  │
│  KICK   │Ambient/ │  Bell/  │
│  (Main) │  Drone  │  Chime  │
└─────────┴─────────┴─────────┘
```

**Consistency Rule:** Pad 1 = ALWAYS KICK (muscle memory during performance)

### Performance Notes
- **LOCK AT 120 BPM FOR MINIMUM 2 MINUTES**
- This is peak effectiveness for breath synchronization
- Hypnotic, steady, unwavering pulse
- Don't rush - tempo stability = maximum entrainment
- Use vocal samples (pad 8) to encourage participation
- Play with intensity/dynamics, NOT tempo
- Research foundation: 120 BPM = optimal for nervous system activation

### Critical Instructions
- Set metronome/click to 120 BPM
- DO NOT DEVIATE from 120 BPM during peak hold
- This is the climax of Phases 2 & 4
- Band must lock together perfectly here

- Stereo Width: Wide (immersive)
- Master Volume: MAXIMUM SAFE (fff if possible)

### Performance Notes
- This is the BREAKTHROUGH zone
- Can briefly spike to 128, then settle back to 120
- Emotional release happens here (crying, laughing, shaking)
- Dense rhythmic texture, polyrhythmic layers
- Call-and-response with vocal samples
- Hold intensity, maintain tempo precision
- Final minute (30-31): signal descent coming

### Warning
- Maximum intensity without chaos

## Kit Switching Strategy

### Smooth Transitions

**Method 1: On-the-One Switch**
- Prepare next kit number
- On beat 1 of new phrase: switch instantly
- SPD-SX Pro switches are instant (no audio gap)

**Method 2: Fill Switch**
- Play 2-4 bar fill
- During final beat of fill: switch kit
- New kit starts on downbeat

**Method 3: Texture Fade**
- Reduce playing to ambient pads only
- Switch kit during ambient sustain
- Re-introduce drums with new kit

### Critical Transition Moments

## SPD-SX Pro Programming Workflow

### Step 1: Organize Sample Files
```
/SPDSX-Breathing-Session/
  /Kit-1-44bpm/
    kick-floor-tom.wav
    drone-om.wav
    bowl-tibetan-low.wav
    ...
  /Kit-2-48bpm/
    kick-soft.wav
    ocean-waves-long.wav
    ...
  [etc for all 8 kits]
```

### Step 2: Load into SPD-SX Pro
1. Connect USB drive with organized folders
2. Bank 1 → Kits 1-4 (44, 48, 60, 72 BPM)
3. Bank 2 → Kits 5-8 (90, 100, 120, 128 BPM)
4. Load samples to consistent pad positions

### Step 3: Set BPM per Kit
- Kit settings → Tempo → Lock to specified BPM
- Verify with metronome output
- Test sync with loops/sequenced samples

### Step 4: Effects per Kit
- Individual pad effects (reverb, EQ)
- Master effects per kit
- Save each kit with effects embedded

### Step 5: Create Setlist
- Order kits in performance sequence
- Or organize by bank for quick access
- Label clearly (use LCD names)

### Step 6: Backup
- Save all kits to USB
- Keep backup USB drive
- Export kit settings (if SPD-SX Pro supports)

## Performance Notes & Best Practices

### Pre-Session
- [ ] All 8 kits loaded and tested
- [ ] Samples triggering correctly on all pads
- [ ] BPMs verified for each kit
- [ ] Effects settings saved per kit
- [ ] Backup USB drive ready
- [ ] Click track setup (in-ear) synced to kit BPMs
- [ ] Kit switching practiced during rehearsal

### During Session
- Keep kit number reference visible (tape on SPD-SX or nearby)
- Mark transition moments on setlist
- Use click track for tempo accuracy (especially at 120 BPM)
- Trust your preparation - don't second-guess switches

### Emergency Backup
- If SPD-SX fails: acoustic kit + tambourine + ocean drum
- Pre-load most critical kits: 2 (48), 7 (120), 1 (44)
- Keep extra USB drive with all samples

## Quick Reference: BPM to Breathing Rate

| Kit BPM | Breathing Pattern | Breaths/Min | Nervous System State |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| 44 | 1 breath per 6+ beats | 4-5 | Deep parasympathetic |
| 48 | 1 breath per 4-6 beats | 6-8 | Parasympathetic activation |
| 60 | 1 breath per 3-4 beats | 10-12 | Balanced transition |
| 72 | 1 breath per 3 beats | 12-15 | Mild sympathetic activation |
| 90 | 1 breath per 2 beats | 18-22 | Moderate sympathetic activation |
| 100 | ~1 breath per beat | 20-25 | High sympathetic activation |
| 120⭐ | 1-2 breaths per beat | 25-30 | **Optimal entrainment** |
| 128 | 2+ breaths per beat | 30+ | Maximum sympathetic activation |

---

## Maintenance & Updates

### After Each Session
- Check samples for clicks/pops
- Review which pads were most/least used
- Note any technical issues
- Update sample assignments if needed

### Iteration Ideas
- Record session, analyze what worked
- Test alternative samples for specific pads
- Fine-tune effects based on room acoustics
- Adjust volumes for pad balance

---

## Final Checklist: Are You Ready?

- [ ] All 8 kits programmed with correct BPMs
- [ ] Pad 1 = Kick on all kits (consistency)
- [ ] Calm kits (1-3) have long reverbs, low frequencies
- [ ] Energetic kits (5-8) have tight sounds, bright EQ
- [ ] Kit 7 (120 BPM) is your most powerful, precise kit
- [ ] Kit switching transitions practiced
- [ ] Backup plan in place
- [ ] Sample library backed up

---

**Remember:** You're not just playing drums - you're guiding breath, which guides nervous systems, which creates transformation.

**The 120 BPM kit (Kit 7) is your most important weapon. Master it.**

**Trust the tempo. Trust the samples. Trust the process.**
